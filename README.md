# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognizer with GUI

A simple yet powerful Handwritten Digit Recognition application using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The app features a user-friendly interface created with Tkinter that allows users to upload an image and get real-time digit predictions.

---

## 💡 Features

- Digit recognition from handwritten images using a trained ANN model
- Intuitive GUI built with Tkinter
- Image preprocessing pipeline (grayscale, resize, normalization)
- Easy image upload and instant prediction
- Sample image dataset for testing
- Model training notebook included

## 🔧 How to Use This Repository

This repo has two main purposes:  
**(1) Use the GUI for predictions**  
**(2) Train your own model (optional)**

---

### 🖼️ 1. Use the GUI to Predict Handwritten Digits

> **Pre-requisite:** Python 3.7+ with required packages installed.

#### ✅ Steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-recognizer-gui.git
   cd digit-recognizer-gui
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the GUI**
   ```bash
   python digit_gui.py
   ```

4. **Use the App**
   - Click the **“Select your image to be processed!”** button.
   - Choose an image (you can use ones from the `sample_digits/` folder).
   - View the predicted digit in the app window and console output.

### 🧠 2. Train Your Own ANN Model

> Use this if you want to retrain the model from scratch.

#### 🛠️ Steps:

1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook train.ipynb
   ```

2. Run through the cells to:
   - Load and preprocess MNIST dataset
   - Train a simple ANN
   - Save the model as `Handwritten_digit_ann_model_best.h5`

3. Replace the model file used by `digit_gui.py` with your new `.h5` file.
